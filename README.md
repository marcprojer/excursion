## Credits

This project was created as part of a learning experience and is inspired by the Codecademy "Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages" curriculum.

# Off-Platform Project: Excursion

The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so i used a video and a landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

I worked with Git and GitHub on my local machine for this project, check the final product: https://marcprojer.github.io/excursion/
